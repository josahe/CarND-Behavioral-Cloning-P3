# Behavioural Cloning Project
> Cloning simulated human driving behaviour using a CNN

## INTRODUCTION
In this project, I used Keras and TensorFlow to implement a convolution neural network that was trained to clone human driving behaviour captured in a simulator. The network was then used to autonomously predict steering angles in the simulator to successfully drive the car around a track. A more detailed write-up is included in this project.

This project was undertaken as part of the [Udacity Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013).
