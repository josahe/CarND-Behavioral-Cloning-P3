# Behaviorial Cloning Project

## Overview
---
This repository contains my modified files for the Udacity Behavioral Cloning Project.

In this project, we had to clone simulated human driving behavior, by training, validating and testing a CNN model using Keras. The model outputs a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

* model.py contains the script to create and train the model
* model.h5 is my trained convolution neural network
* writeup_report.md summarises my solution
* video.mp4 is a demo of the simulation using my trained model
